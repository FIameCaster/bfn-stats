# BFN Stats React

React version of the BFN Stats website I made to learn React. It's [hosted on netlify](https://bfn-stats-react.netlify.app).

This is a normal Vite react-ts, so to run it locally, install dependencies `npm install` and run the dev server `npm run dev`

There's absolutely no reason to use this website unless you want to compare it to the original as it ships much more javascript to the browser, is significantly slower, has terrible SEO and doesn't have any extra features.
