# BFN Stats

BFN Stats is a website for viewing statistics for all playable characters in PVZ Battle for Neighborville, both primary weapons and abilities. The website includes a TTK Calculator, detailed upgrade descriptions, a sortable table for an overview of all stats and a page for comparing classes.

### Usage

The website is hosted with Netlify: https://bfn-stats.netlify.app.

If you wish to run it locally, install dependencies:

	npm install

And run the dev command which both runs the build script and starts the dev server:

	npm run dev

Next time you can run the start command which doesn't run the build script

	npm run start
