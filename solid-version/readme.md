# BFN Stats Solid

SolidJS version of the BFN Stats website I made to learn SolidJS. It's [hosted on netlify](https://bfn-stats-solid.netlify.app).

To run it locally, install dependencies `npm install` and run the dev server `npm run dev`

While this version is significantly faster and smaller than the React version, it still can't compete with the original and shouldn't be used for anything else than comparison.

Was a very pleasant experience developing this version due to the flexibility Solid's signals have compared to `useState` in React. In the end, the code ended up much cleaner with zero downsides in comparison to React.
